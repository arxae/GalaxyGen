RantVocab
==============

This repository contains the standard dictionary files used by me while developing Rant. You may use, modify and distribute them as you wish.

**Fair warning:** The files contain entries that some people may find offensive. Rant filters these out by default, but you can enable them by passing `NsfwFilter.Allow` to the `Engine` constructor.
